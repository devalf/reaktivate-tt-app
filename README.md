## Project Overview (testing task)

### Stack: React, Mobx

I was tasked with refactoring legacy code and building an improved application on top of it. The key requirements
included:

- Creating a clear and organized file structure
- Splitting the code into appropriate logical components
- Implementing comprehensive tests

I also defined proper API types based on the available Swagger documentation, despite the lack of explicitly described
types in those docs.

You can find the original version of the code in the `src/original-code` folder

#### Getting Started
